# Bamazon

Bamazon is like an Amazon storefront. Using Javascipt, Node and MySQL. 
The node app bamazoncustomer.js will take orders from the customers and deplete stock from bamazon inventory. The user will be prompted to select product they want to but and the amount. If the item is out of stock it will show as "insuffecient stock".


Technology required.
Javascript MySQL, NODE


I only chose to do the customer. I found this homework to be really hard. Getting everything to connect and run smoothly on terminal was not easy.
